Let's talk github pages.

There's the main gh-pages repo "thelysdexicone.github.io". I have a separate repot ball-x-pit-companion that I can get to by going to "thelysdexicone.github.io/ball-x-pit-companion". Is this the best way to approach different "projects" or should I build everything within the main "thelysdexicone.github.io" repo and have one large repot with all of my project sites in it.

I play on adding more projects over time, so I want to make sure I'm setting up the structure in a way that will be easy to maintain and scale as I add more projects.
