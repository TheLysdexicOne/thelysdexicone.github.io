## The Pivot: Executive Decision

- Remove ball-x-pit-companion from the monorepo and keep it as a separate repo
- The monorepo ball-x-pit-companion will now be called just ball-x-pit.

  - Icarus
  - Kingdom Come Deliverance II
  - Blue Prince
  - Factorio
  - Satisfactory
  - Widget Inc.
- Cards should have placeholder icons and "Coming Soon" text
- Update the pinned projects as Ball-X-Pit and Icarus
