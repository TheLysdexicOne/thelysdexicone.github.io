## Project Structure

- Root: `thelysdexicone.github.io` is a monorepo for GitHub Pages frontends.
- Landing page: `landing-page/` (Next.js App Router) serves the root URL.
- Projects: `projects/<project-id>/` (Next.js apps) serve as subpaths.
- Shared code: `shared/` for reusable styles and utilities.
- Build output: `dist/` (generated by `npm run deploy`).

## Dev Commands

- Install all: `npm run install-all`
- Landing dev: `npm run dev:landing`
- Companion dev: `npm run dev:companion`
- Build all: `npm run build`
- Deploy build: `npm run deploy`

## GitHub Pages Notes

- Each project uses `output: 'export'`.
- Production uses `basePath` and `assetPrefix` per project.
- `.nojekyll` is required for Next.js static exports.

## Documentation Rules

- AI-generated docs go only in `.github/documentation/`.
- `.github/documentation/` is ignored by git.
- Do not add new docs outside that folder unless explicitly requested.
